## Stealthy

Stealthy is a decentralized and encrypted communication protocol that empowers users to have a unified chat experience (think cross-platform & open iMessage). 

With Stealthy, developers can focus on building their dream dApp and offload the communication infrastructure to our protocol.

Check it out at https://www.stealthy.im

## Motivation

This project stemmed from the increasing control companies place on user data. The big 4 tech companies control and leverage our data for profits without regard for our privacy or data safety.

Stealthy finally offers users a decentralized alternative to the status quo. With Stealthy, end users have a rich app experience not restricted by App Silos. At the same time, developers and content creators can reach a diverse network of users directly through our protocol.

Stealthy has a standalone mobile app that will soon be available in both the Apple and Google App store. Stealthy is open source and available for contributions. 

## Code

If you're just starting with Stealthy, here are the main software repositories you should checkout:

- [Stealthy Web App](https://github.com/stealthyim/webapp) - the implementation of Stealthy's web p2p chat product that won Blockstack's communication hackathon written in React JS.
- [Stealthy Mobile App](https://github.com/stealthyim/mobile) - the implementation of Stealthy's iOS/Android app that has dApp integrations, e2e chat, notifications, discovery, etc written in React Native JS (pending).

## Protocol Architecture

Stealthy has been used in production since March 2018 and currently has 5 dApp integrations. Our protocol works on web and mobile with cross platform support for encryption.

With the Stealthy communication protocol, dApps can communicate offline, real time (video, chat), and process transactions*. This is accomplished with a lite ledger methodology, only authentication requires blockchain, and the communication protocol is off-chain. This allows dApps to be as effecient (98%) as centralized counterparts. 

The Stealthy communication protocol is shown below:

## Social Graph & Contact Discovery

Stealthy uses public key encryption to setup communications between users. Standalone dApps need to setup a new network of users that need to login to the app before discovery/communications can begin.

With Stealthy, dApp partners get access to the social graph of Stealthy and other dApp partners immediately. The end user also benefits by being able to immediately collaborate with their existing contacts. This allows a larger audience for your dApp without the headaches of rebuilding the wheel each time.

## Developer Partnerships

If you're interested in building a communication centric dApp or add communication to your existing dApp, please reach out to us at [support@stealthy.im](mailto:support@stealthy.im).
